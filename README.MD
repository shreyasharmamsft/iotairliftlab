Welcome to the Azure Time Series Insights Hands on lab! Azure IoT Time Series Insights (TSI) is an end-to-end platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering. You can use TSI to ingest, store, contextualize, query and visualize data at industrial scale.

Time Series Insights is designed for ad hoc data exploration and operational analysis. It's an extensible and customized service offering that meets the broad needs of industrial IoT deployments. 

## Introduction and Outline

You are a consultant for Contoso Wind Farm--a utility company in the Northeast with a diverse energy portfolio. Contoso Wind Farm operates a dozen wind farms, and they have tasked you with creating a cloud storage and analytics solution that includes a user-interface for the operations hub managers. A cloud gateway device has already been configured to ingest data from a handful of wind mills at four of their farms so that you can get started!

You will go through the following steps to deploy your solution using TSI:

1. [Event Hub Set-Up and Device Simulation](step-01-hub-and-data-sim/)
1. [TSI Environment Set-Up](step-02-tsi-env-creation/)
1. [TSI Explorer Overview](step-03-explorer-intro/)
1. [Time Series Model (TSM) Creation](step-04-tsm-creation/)
1. [Query and Chart Time Series](step-05-charting/)
1. [Query using APIs](step-06-postman-apis/)
2. [Links to Additional Resource](step--007-resource-links/)
